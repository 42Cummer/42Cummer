# HELLO THERE! ðŸ‘‹
*Am I working hard or hardly working?*     

#### Computer Science Major at UofT

### About Me  
- Interested in **Quantum Computing** and its applications in  **Machine Learning + AI**, **Chemistry** and **Aviation**.  
- Project co-leader in implemeting a Quantum Graph Generative Adversarial Neural Network for molecular synthesis as part of Aspiring Scholars Directed Research Program. (Jan 2023 -- Sep, 2024)
- Technical Paper Talk @ IEEE Quantum Week (Sep 2024 @ Montreal, QC)
- Poster Presentation @ IEEE Quantum Week (Sep 2024 @ Bellevue, WA)
- Poster Presentation @ West Coast Biological Sciences Undergraduate Research Conference (Apr 2023 @ LMU)
- Previously (attempted to) implement a Quantum Convolutional Neural Network for Efficient Image Recognition (2022)

### Publications
- First version (proof-of-concept) of QGAN [published in JEI](https://emerginginvestigators.org/articles/22-143)
- Quantum Week 2023 Proceeding available [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10313850) *must have IEEE account to view*
